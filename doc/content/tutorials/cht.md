# Conjugate Heat Transfer Coupling of NekRS and MOOSE

This tutorial describes how to use NekRS to solve for fluid flow and heat transfer
coupled to a solid described by the MOOSE heat conduction module. Three examples are
provided - a section of a laminar reflector block in a [!ac](PB-FHR), a bare laminar 7-pin
[!ac](SFR) fuel bundle, and a turbulent heated channel flow.
