# One-way coupled fluid-structure interaction

## Introduction to benchmark
(with warning to not use it as such)

## Case Setup

### Description of mesh files

  Parameters you can control at the top, where mesh refinement may be necessary (near edges)

### Description of Nek input files

  Description of velocity profile,

### Setup of tensor mechancics

### Description of Cardinal input files

### Coupling description
  Mirror, transfer of mesh velocity/traction

## Initial Condition Generation

  Motivation: Incomp. fluid, sudden shift, displacement, negative Jacobians
  Better to ease it into the displaced state
